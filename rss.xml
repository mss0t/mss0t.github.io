What is \(\sqrt2\)? By definition, it is a number whose square is 2, or put a bit more algebraicly, it is a solution to the polynomial equation \(x^2 - 2 = 0\). However, these are just properties of \(\sqrt2\) and a priori do not necessairly define the object. As to avoid anymore metaphysical waffleing, here's one possible answer: \(\sqrt2\) is an irrational real number, approximately equal to 1.41421356237. Of course, if you're reading a post about mathematics on the internet, it's highly likely this isn't any new information to you, so why bring it up? Simply put, investigating why this statement is true reveals something quite fundemental about the real numbers. With that out of the way, let's address the first qualifier, irrantionality.

Before we dive into a proof, let's establish what we want to prove in the first place. Since we haven't actually defined a real number \(\sqrt2\) yet, we're only going to show that a number satisfying the main property of \(\sqrt2\), i.e. being a solution to \(x^2 - 2 = 0\) cannot be found when we limit ourselves to the subset of rational numbers. We can reduce this to the subset of positive rational numbers as well by noticing that a negative solution implies a positive solution and vice versa since \(x^2 = (-x)^2\), and that 0 is obviously not a solution. Therefore, if a rational solution did exist, it would be of the form \(x = \frac{a}{b}\) where \(a,b\) are positive integers. So we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist such positive integers such that \((\frac{a}{b})^2 - 2 = 0\). Simplifying a little, we see that \(a^2 = 2b^2\). Reframing this geometrically, we can think of three squares: two with side lengths \(b\) and the other with side lengths \(a\) such that the combined area of the two smaller sqaures is equal to the area of the larger square. This means that \(a^2\) is even, so \(a\) must also be even since if it was odd \(a^2\) would also be. We can thus create 4 squares of integer side length, which we'll call \(c\), by quartering the square with side lengths \(a\). Since one square with side length \(b\) is half the area of the square with side lengths \(a\), two of the squares of side lengths \(c\) have the same combined area. So we end up with a smaller version of the original problem. Rpeating this process, we can create smaller and smaller pairs of positive integers \(a,b\) which satisfy \(a^2 = 2b^2\). However, this leads to a contradiction since no matter how large the integer you start from, you eventually reach 0 by counting down. So the initial assumption of a rational solution to \(x^2 - 2 =0\) must be wrong.
